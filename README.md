# Data Mining - Final Project

In this project we offer classification using:
k.n.n,kmeans,id3 and naive bayes classifiers
on a giving numpy train data set

## Getting Started

for now the only why to run this application is to run
Gui.py in any IDE using a compatible interpreter

Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests
